=item agentforward

If the host has been specified, and agentforward is true, the login to that
host will use SSH Agent Forwarding.

=item xforward

If the host has been specified, and xforward is true, the login to that host
will use SSH X Forwarding.

=back


=head1 OTHER METHODS

=over 4

=item launch($debug);

Calculates (and returns) the command that will launch your gnome-terminal.
It also runs that command in a child process - unless $debug is specified.

=item terminalArgs();

Return the arguments that will be passed to the gnome-terminal.  This will
provide the customisations.  There should be no reason to call this method
directly.
=cut

sub terminalArgs {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $args = "";
    if ( my $name = $self->profile() ) {
        $args .= " --window-with-profile=$name";
    }
    if ( my $geo = $self->geometry() ) {
        $args .= " -geometry $geo";
    }
    return "$args";
}

=item terminalName();

Returns the name of the executable program that we want to run.  There
should be no reason to call this method directly.
=cut

sub terminalName {
    return "gnome-terminal";
}
