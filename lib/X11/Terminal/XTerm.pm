=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Each of the following attributes provide an accessor method, but they can also be set in the constructor.

=over 4
 
=item host

Specifies the remote host to log in to (using ssh).

=item agentforward

If the host has been specified, and agentforward is true, the login to that host will use SSH Agent Forarding.

=item xforward

If the host has been specified, and xforward is true, the login to that host will use SSH X Forarding.

=item foreground

Set the forground colour to be used in the XTerm window

=item background

Set the background colour to be used in the XTerm window

=item scrollback

Set the number of lines that should be stored made accessable via the xterm scrollback buffer

=item font

Set the font used in the XTerm window

=item profile

Set the X11 resource name used by the XTerm window

=item geometry

Set the preferred size and position of the XTerm window

=back


=head1 OTHER METHODS

=over 4

=item launch($debug);

Calculates (and returns) the command that will launch your xterm.  It also runs that command in a child process - unless $debug is specified.

=item terminalArgs();

Return the arguments that will be passed to the xterm.  This will provide the customisations.  There should be no reason to call this method directly.
