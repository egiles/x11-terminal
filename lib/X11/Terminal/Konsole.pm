	my $t1 = X11::Terminal::Konsole->new();
	my $t2 = X11::Terminal::Konsole->new(host => "remoteserver");
	my $t3 = X11::Terminal::Konsole->new(profile => "special");

	for ( $t1, $t2, $t3 ) {
	  $_->launch();

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Each of the following attributes provide an accessor method, but they can also be set in the constructor.

=over 4
 
=item host

Specifies the remote host to log in to (using ssh).

=item agentforward

If the host has been specified, and agentforward is true, the login to that host will use SSH Agent Forarding.

=item xforward

If the host has been specified, and xforward is true, the login to that host will use SSH X Forarding.

=item profile

Set the Konsole profile name

=back


=head1 OTHER METHODS

=over 4

=item launch($debug);

Calculates (and returns) the command that will launch your gnome-terminal.  It also runs that command in a child process - unless $debug is specified.

=item terminalArgs();

Return the arguments that will be passed to the gnome-terminal.  This will provide the customisations.  There should be no reason to call this method directly.
